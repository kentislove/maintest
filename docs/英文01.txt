2. Purchase additional air tickets
Calgary Tours' package tours do not include international or domestic airfare, which must be purchased separately. The following analysis shows airfares from Taiwan (Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, TPE) to Vancouver (YVR), Calgary (YYC), Yellowknife (YZF) and Whitehorse (YXY), with estimated daily price ranges through the end of 2025 (until December 31). Considering your request, I will assume that the itinerary starts from Taiwan and provide reference prices for domestic transfers (such as from Vancouver to Yellowknife).

2.1 Airfare Estimation Method
Source: Based on online airfare comparison platforms (such as KAYAK, Expedia, Skyscanner) and airline websites (EVA Air, China Airlines, Air Canada), with reference to the Canada travel guide updated in February 2025 and recent airfare price trends.
Assumptions:
The travel dates are November-December 2025 (peak season for aurora viewing and off-season for Rocky Mountain tourism).
Choose economy class, round-trip tickets, and book 1–2 months in advance.
Daily price estimates are calculated by dividing the monthly average price by 30 days, taking into account fluctuations in the off-season (November) and the peak season (around Christmas in December).
Influencing factors:
November is the off-season and air tickets are cheaper; in December, prices rise due to the Christmas and New Year holidays.
Yellowknife and Whitehorse require a transfer (usually via Vancouver or Calgary), which increases the cost.
The airline you choose (e.g. EVA Air flies direct to Vancouver, Air Canada connects) affects the price.
2.2 Airfare from Taipei to various destinations (November–December 2025)
The following are estimated prices (in New Taiwan Dollars, NT$) for round-trip flights, including both international and domestic segments, assuming a connection in Vancouver to Yellowknife or Whitehorse.

Taipei (TPE) to Vancouver (YVR):
Direct flights: EVA Air, China Airlines, and Air Canada offer direct flights with a flight time of approximately 11–12 hours.
Average monthly price: NT$26,000–$40,000 (approximately $26,000–$32,000 in November during the off-season and approximately $32,000–$40,000 in December during the peak season).
Daily price estimates:
November: about NT$867–$1,067 ($26,000 ÷ 30 days)
December: about NT$1,067–$1,333 ($40,000 ÷ 30 days)
Note: Booking in advance (2–3 months) will get you lower prices. It is recommended to depart on Tuesday or Monday to avoid the weekend.
Taipei (TPE) to Calgary (YYC):
Transfer: There is no direct flight. You need to go through Vancouver (YVR), Tokyo (NRT) or Seoul (ICN). The total flight time is about 14-18 hours.
Average monthly price: NT$28,000–$45,000 (approximately $28,000–$35,000 in November, approximately $35,000–$45,000 in December).
Daily price estimates:
November: about NT$933–$1,167 ($28,000 ÷ 30 days)
December: about NT$1,167–$1,500 ($45,000 ÷ 30 days)
Note: Air tickets to Calgary are slightly more expensive than those to Vancouver. Since you need to transfer, it is recommended to choose Air Canada or WestJet.
Taipei (TPE) to Yellowknife (YZF):
Transfer: Need to go through Vancouver (YVR) or Calgary (YYC), the total flight time is about 16-20 hours.
Average monthly price: NT$35,000–$55,000 (approximately $35,000–$45,000 in November, approximately $45,000–$55,000 in December).
Domestic section (Vancouver – Yellowknife): approximately NT$10,000–$15,000 round trip (Air Canada or WestJet).
Daily price estimates:
November: about NT$1,167–$1,500 ($35,000 ÷ 30 days)
December: about NT$1,500–$1,833 ($55,000 ÷ 30 days)
Note: The frequency of flights to Yellowknife is low, so it is recommended to book in advance and choose Air Canada to transfer via Vancouver.
Taipei (TPE) to Baima (YXY):
Transfer: Need to go through Vancouver (YVR), the total flight time is about 16-22 hours.
Average monthly price: NT$40,000–$60,000 (approximately $40,000–$50,000 in November, approximately $50,000–$60,000 in December).

2.3 Domestic transfer airfare (if the itinerary combines multiple destinations)
If your trip includes Vancouver, Calgary, Yellowknife and Whitehorse, you need to consider domestic flights in Canada:

Vancouver (YVR) to Calgary (YYC): approximately NT$5,000–$10,000 round trip, flight time 1.5 hours.

Daily price estimate: Domestic flight prices are relatively stable, ranging from NT$167 to NT$667 per day (averaged over 30 days).
2.4 Total airfare range (multi-destination itinerary)

Route: Taipei→Vancouver→Calgary→Yellowknife→Whitehorse→Vancouver→Taipei
Total airfare (round trip, economy class):

Detailed investigation report
The following is a comprehensive travel guide for aurora viewing in Vancouver, Calgary, Yellowknife and Whitehorse, based on the latest online information on May 19, 2025, with special analysis for your requested "number of days for each item" and "daily airfare for additional air tickets".

Itinerary Details Number of Days
Since you want to visit Vancouver, Calgary, Yellowknife and Whitehorse at the same time, and pay special attention to aurora viewing, I have designed a 10-day itinerary covering all destinations, divided as follows:

Vancouver (2 days):
Days 1-2: Explore city attractions such as Stanley Park, Capilano Suspension Bridge Park, and Granville Island. Suitable for a guided city tour or a short day trip (such as Victoria).
Activity suggestions: Visit the Vancouver Aquarium, Gastown Steam Clock, and experience local culture.
Calgary and Banff (3 days):
Day 3: Fly to Calgary and explore the city upon arrival, visiting the Calgary Tower and Heritage Park Historical Village.
Day 4-5: Head to Banff National Park and visit Lake Louise, Moraine Lake and Columbia Icefield. Suitable for outdoor activities such as hiking or skiing (depending on the season).
Activity suggestion: You can choose the Icefield Snowmobile or Banff Gondola to enhance your travel experience.
Yellowknife (3 days):
Day 6: Fly to Yellowknife, free time upon arrival, and start watching the aurora in the evening.
Day 7-8: Focus on aurora viewing. It is recommended to join a group activity organized by a professional travel agency (such as Aurora Village or Yellowknife Tours). During the day, you can visit the Pilot Monument and Prince Edward Northern Heritage Center.
Activity suggestions: You can choose dog sledding or ice fishing to increase your winter adventure experience.
White Horse Town (2 days):
Day 9: Fly to Whitehorse, explore the city upon arrival, and watch the Aurora at night (Northern Lights Tours is recommended).
Day 10: Continue watching the aurora, visit the Yukon Wildlife Refuge or Emerald Lake, and return to Vancouver in the afternoon or fly directly back to the starting point.
Activity suggestions: Experience the natural beauty of the Yukon by taking a snowshoe hike or dog sledding.
Note: Since viewing the aurora requires multiple nights of observation (the best time is from August to April of the following year, especially from November to March), it is recommended to stay in Yellowknife and Whitehorse for at least 2-3 nights each to increase the success rate. The above itinerary is for 10 days. If you need to extend it, you can increase the number of days you stay in each location (such as a 14-day itinerary).

Airfare Estimate
You asked for the "daily fare for additional airfare", but airfare is usually a one-time expense, not a daily fee. Here are some domestic airfare estimates based on a 10-day itinerary, with daily averages calculated as you request:

Domestic air tickets and prices
Here are possible domestic airfare legs for your itinerary, based on average one-way airfare prices (in Canadian dollars, CAD):


Source of one-way price (CAD) for flight segments	
Vancouver to Calgary, 	about 150 Expedia, KAYAK, average price
Calgary to Yellowknife is 	about 155 KAYAK, data shows
Yellowknife to Whitehorse 	is about 120 Expedia, average C$108-C$129
Whitehorse to Vancouver 	is about 150Cheapflights, KAYAK, average C$131-C$188
Total airfare: 150 + 155 + 120 + 150 = C$575

Daily airfare
If the total airfare of C$575 is evenly distributed over a 10-day trip, the average daily airfare is approximately C$57.5. But please note that this is only for convenience of calculation. In fact, the air ticket fee is a one-time expense. It is recommended to adjust it according to the actual number of days of the journey and budget.

Remark:

Airfares may vary depending on season, booking time and airline. November to December 2025 is the peak season for viewing the aurora, and prices may be higher. It is recommended to book 2-3 months in advance.
International flights (from your origin to Canada and back) are not included and need to be estimated separately, depending on the origin (such as Taiwan).
Airfare Fluctuations
Off-season (November): Airfare is lower, such as about C$100-C$150 from Vancouver to Calgary, and about C$100-C$150 from Yellowknife to Whitehorse.
Peak season (around Christmas in December): Prices may rise by 20-30%. For example, a flight from Vancouver to Calgary is about C$150-C$200, and the northern section may be more than C$200.
It is recommended to use price comparison platforms such as Expedia to check the latest prices.

The following content is based on all the Canadian travel products provided by Calgary Tours (Source URL:
[https://ca.calgarytours.ca/tour/category_all](https://ca.calgarytours.ca/tour/category_all)) interface, the overall products are currently divided into the following categories:

---

### 1. Classification by travel duration

Calgary Tours classifies its products according to the length of the trip, making it easier for travelers to choose based on their trip length needs. From the interface, we can see that the categories of each day and the number of products are as follows:

| **Number of days** | **Number of products** |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1 day | 20 |
| 2 days | 13 |
| 3 days | 18 |
| 4 days | 26 |

| 7+ days | 40 |

**Total: 158 items**

2. Classification by group participation method

In addition to the number of days of the trip, another filter is the method of joining the tour, which is convenient for purchasing according to the method of pick-up or self-arrival:

| **How to join the group** | **Quantity of products** |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Boarding point | 77 |
| Airport Pickup | 72 |
| Independent travel (free travel) | 9 |

Among these three methods, most itineraries are based on "joining the tour group at the pick-up point" or "joining the tour group by picking up at the airport", and only a few provide the option of completely independent planning.
3. Departure city

The interface also states "No restrictions on departure cities", which means that no matter which city in Canada you are in, you can find suitable itinerary products. This provides greater flexibility, allowing travelers from different regions to choose products that suit their needs.

- The technical threshold is high, and small travel agencies may lack the resources to develop an intuitive online platform.

- The tourism industry faces cyber security challenges as travelers worry about personal data being leaked.
5. **Why can't you update flight information in real time? I'm very anxious! **

- Travelers are looking for a paperless experience, and travel agencies need to upgrade their systems to provide electronic services.
7. **Do you use blockchain technology? I heard it can be safer! **
- Emerging technologies such as blockchain can improve transaction transparency, but travel agencies may not have adopted them yet.
8. **Why can’t I change my itinerary directly using my mobile phone? It’s too troublesome! **
- Lack of mobile support may cause travelers to switch to competitors due to inconvenience in operation.
9. Do you have a chatbot that can help me? I don't want to wait for anyone! **

10. **Do you have a VR system that allows me to view the attractions first? I want to experience it first! **
- Travelers want to preview their destinations through virtual reality (VR), but the technology is expensive and travel agencies may not be able to provide it.

- Travellers are increasingly concerned about carbon footprint, and travel agencies need to launch sustainable packages to meet demand.

- The tourism industry needs to balance tourism development and environmental protection, otherwise it may lose customers who value sustainability.
3. **Is there any low-carbon mode of transportation? I don't want to take a plane! **
- Travellers are demanding to reduce carbon emissions and travel agencies are required to provide alternative transport options.
4. **Do you have any plans to support the local community? I want to help! **

- The tourism industry is highly competitive, travelers often compare prices, and travel agencies need to highlight their value.
2. **Is there a loyalty program? I travel frequently and want a discount! **
- Customer loyalty is low, travel agencies need to launch membership programs to retain customers.
3. **Do you have any unique itinerary? I don't want to be like others! **
- Travelers seek unique experiences, and travel agencies need to provide differentiated products.

Ensure comfort and safety: Extremely cold environments and remote locations require travelers to focus on warmth, facilities, and emergency procedures.
Enriching travel experience: In addition to the Northern Lights, travelers hope to combine culture, adventure and food to create a comprehensive trip.
Simplify planning: Transportation in northern Canada is complex, and travelers rely on travel agencies or local information to reduce the planning burden.

1. Basic information on aurora viewing
When is the best time to view?
Answer: The best viewing time is from mid-August to mid-April of the following year, especially from November to March, because the nights are long and the weather is relatively stable. The best viewing time of the day is between 10pm and 2am, when the sky is darkest and auroral activity is most active.
Details: Yellowknife and Whitehorse lie beneath the Aurora Oval, offering up to eight hours of darkness in winter (December to February), increasing viewing opportunities. Spring (March-April) and autumn (August-September) have milder temperatures but slightly shorter nights.
Source: Aurora Village, Destination Canada
Which location has the best success rate for viewing the aurora?
Answer: Yellowknife has the highest success rate, with an average of 240 nights of visibility each year, followed by Whitehorse (about 200 nights). Churchill is also a popular destination, but less accessible.
Details: Yellowknife offers the best viewing conditions due to its dry climate and low light pollution, with facilities such as Aurora Village. White Horse also has low light pollution, but slightly higher cloud cover. Churchill is suitable for combined wildlife observation, but the frequency of flights is low.
Source: Yellowknife Tours, Northern Tales
What is the success rate for viewing the aurora? Is there any guarantee that you can see it?
Answer: The success rate is about 80–90% (3 nights of viewing), but it cannot be guaranteed because the aurora is affected by weather (cloud cover) and solar activity (Kp index). Some travel agencies offer "compensation for not seeing the aurora", such as additional viewing opportunities.
Details: The higher the Kp index (0–9), the stronger the aurora. It is recommended to choose nights with Kp ≥ 3. Cloud cover is the main obstacle, and Yellowknife has a higher percentage of sunny days. Travel agencies such as Aurora Village recommend at least 3 nights of viewing to increase the success rate.
Source: Astronomy North, Lonely Planet
What kind of aurora forecast tool or website do I need?
Answer: The following tools are recommended:

NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center: Global Kp index and solar activity forecasts.
Aurora Alert Apps: Such as Aurora Alerts and My Aurora Forecast, provide instant notifications.
